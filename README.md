# Healing Stones - Reconstructing digitized cultural heritage artifacts with artificial intelligence
 Healing Stones is a 3D reconstruction project focused on digitally restoring fragmented cultural artifacts using AI and geometry-based techniques. The goal is to reassemble broken stone pieces—believed to have historical or spiritual significance—into their original form, preserving both structure and meaning.  Using 3D scans of stone fragments (in .PLY format), the project employs:  Automated fragment alignment based on surface geometry and dominant plane detection  Feature extraction using descriptors like FPFH  Graph-based matching and optimization to determine the correct placement of each piece  Deep learning models to improve fragment pair matching and reconstruction accuracy  This pipeline allows for the healing and digital restoration of stone artifacts where physical restoration may not be possible, enabling further archaeological analysis, educational exploration, and cultural preservation.
